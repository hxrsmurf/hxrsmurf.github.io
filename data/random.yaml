- quote: >
    I asked my grandpa what it felt like to grow old. Grandpa is a man who will deliberate on which part of the newspaper to start with each morning, so I knew my question would take him some time to answer. I said nothing. I let him gather his thoughts.</br></br>

    When I was a boy, Grandpa had once complimented me on this habit. He told me it was good that I asked a question and gave a person silence. And being that any compliment from him was so few and far between, this habit soon became a part of my personality and one that served me well.</br></br>

    Grandpa stared out the window and looked at the empty bird feeder that hung from an overgrown tree next to the pond he built in the spring of 1993. For twenty years, Grandpa filled up the feeder each evening. But he stopped doing it last winter when walking became too difficult for him.</br></br>

    Without ever taking his eyes from the window, he asked me a question: 'Have you ever been in a hot shower when the water ran cold?' I told him I had.</br></br>

    'That's what aging feels like. In the beginning of your life it's like you're standing in a hot shower. At first the water is too warm, but you eventually grow used to the heat and begin enjoying it. But you take it for granted when you're young and think it's going to be this way forever. Life goes on like this for some time.'</br></br>

    Grandpa looked at me with those eyes that had seen so much change in this world. He smiled and winked at me.</br></br>

    'And if you're lucky, a few good looking women will join you in the shower from time to time.'</br></br>

    We laughed. He looked out the window and continued on.</br></br>

    'You begin to feel it in your forties and fifties. The water temperature declines just the slightest bit. It's almost imperceptible, but you know it happened and you know what it means. You try to pretend like you didn't feel it, but you still turn the faucet up to stay warm. But the water keeps going lukewarm. One day you realize the faucet can't go any further, and from here on out the temperature begins to drop. And everyday you feel the warmth gradually leaving your body.'</br></br>

    Grandpa cleared his throat and pulled a stained handkerchief from his flannel shirt pocket. He blew his nose, balled up the handkerchief, and put it back in his pocket.</br></br>

    'It's a rather helpless feeling, truth told. The water is still pleasant, but you know it will soon become cold and there's nothing you can do about it. This is the point when some people decide to leave the shower on their own terms. They know it's never going to get warmer, so why prolong the inevitable? I was able to stay in because I contented myself recalling the showers of my youth. I lived a good life, but still wish I hadn't taken my youth for granted. But it's too late now. No matter how hard I try, I know I'll never get the hot water back on again.'</br></br>

    He paused for a few moments and kept looking out the window with those eyes that had seen ninety-one years on this Earth. Those eyes that lived through the Great Depression, those eyes that beheld the Pacific Ocean in World War II, those eyes that saw the birth of his three children, five grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren. He had indeed lived a good life, I thought to myself.</br></br>

    'And that's what it feels like to grow old.'

    My dog of 16 years old was getting really sick. He was not just my best friend. He was my only friend through high school. </br></br>
    
    I realized that it was the end and I would have to put him down. I took him to the vet and it was lights out for him. </br></br>
    
    I went to the bank the next day to deposit a check. I was waiting in line and an old man came in with his dog that looked EXACTLY like my dog. </br></br>
    
    As soon as they came in, the dog ran right up to me, stood on it's hind legs and gave me a big hug. </br></br>
    
    'Sorry, sonny. He usually doesn't do that' </br></br>
    
    I said it was fin[e] and the dog just kept staring at me right into my eyes.</br></br> 
    
    I told him that my dog had passed away the other day and we chatted in line for a while. The[n] he said something I will never forget. </br></br>
    
    'You know why he lived for so long? Because he knew you weren't ready to face the world on your own yet. He knew that you we're still a kid. His passing was his way of telling you that you are ready to grow up.' </br></br>
    
    I thanked him and we never saw each other again. RIP Bubba.

- quote: The problem, often not discovered until late in life, is that when you look for things in life like love, meaning, motivation, it implies they are sitting behind a tree or under a rock. The most successful people in life recognize, that in life they create their own love, they manufacture their own meaning, they generate their own motivation. For me, I am driven by two main philosophies, know more today about the world than I knew yesterday. And lessen the suffering of others.
