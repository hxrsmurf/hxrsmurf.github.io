    "I think Disney teaches girls</br>
    Young girls such important lessons that princess fairy tales, you know like</br>

    My dog hates Mexicans too.

    So who ever you share life with whether it be your lover, parent, Grandparent, sister or brother</br>
    Let them know to make sure they knew</br>
    That they were appreciated for taking on the challenge of you</br>
- lyric:
    When you try your best, but you don't succeed</br>

    Stuck in reverse

    Why don't you be the writer</br>
    And decide the words I say?</br>

    Only it's too hard to ask</br>
    Won't you try to help me?
- lyric: Why be a king when you can be a God?


- lyric: >
    I came to the world at a time when it was in need of a villain</br>
    An asshole, that role I think I succeed in fulfilling</br>
    But don't think I ever stopped</br>
    To think I was speaking to children


- lyric: >
    And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness come over me</br>
    As we pulled off to go our separate paths,</br>
    And I saw your headlights as I looked back</br>
    And I'm mad I didn't get the chance to thank you for being my Mom and my Dad


- lyric: >
    I wanted the fame, but not the cover of Newsweek</br>
    Oh, well, guess beggars can't be choosey</br>

    Wanted to be left alone in public. Excuse me

    I don't know which side of me is where the truth lies

- lyric: >
    There's a million words but it's never enough</br>
    I say, 'I love you', 'I'm sorry' but still I get stuck</br>
    If I had a coin for every time, we could be millionaires</br>
    But you don't need the diamonds</br>
    'Cause I got a million ways to show you that I care</br>


- lyric: >
    I'll probably lose you again for a day, maybe 10</br>
    We're broken for a minute, doesn't mean it's the end</br>

    Cause deep down you're my girl in a golden crown</br>
    My princess and I don't wanna let you down

    Someday we gonna rise up on that wind you know</br>
    Someday we gonna dance with those lions</br>
    Someday we gonna break free from these chains and keep on flyin'


- lyric: >
    Think about it every year, so I picked up a pen</br>
    Happy birthday, love you whoever you woulda been</br>
    Happy birthday...
- lyric: >
    Stop it don't look at the gunmen,</br>
    You don't wanna get the soldiers wonderin',</br>
    If you gonna run or not,</br>
    'Cause if you run then you might get shot,</br>
    Other than that try not to think about it,</br>
    Try not to worry 'bout it; bein' so crowded,</br>
    Someday we'll get out, someday, someday.
- lyric: >
    Hey Julie,</br>
    Look what they're doing to me</br>
    Trying to trip me up</br>
    Trying to wear me down</br>
    Julie, I swear, it's so hard to bear it</br>
    And I'd never make it through without you around</br>
    And I'd never make it through without you around
- lyric: When the rich wage war, it's the poor who die.


- lyric: >
    So you can let it be known</br>
    I don't hold back, I hold my own</br>
    I can't be mapped, I can't be cloned</br>
    I can't C-flat, it ain't my tone</br>
    I can't fall back, I came too far


- lyric: >
    I watched you fall apart and chased you to the end.</br>
    I'm left with emptiness that words cannot defend</br>
    You'll never know what I became because of you</br>
    Ten thousand promises, ten thousand ways to lose
- lyric: >
    Cause every day we're getting older</br>
    And every day we all get colder</br>
    We're sick of waiting for our answers...</br>
    Yeah I'm so sick of waiting, for us to make a move
- lyric: You desired my attention but denied my affections, my affections

    Darkness is a harsh term don't you think?</br>
    And yet it dominates the things I see

    There's so many wars we fought</br>
    There's so many things we're not,</br>
    But with what we have,</br>
    I promise you that,</br>
    We're marching on.
- lyric: Don't trust a perfect person and don't trust a song that's flawless.
- lyric: > 
    We'll be miles apart</br>
    I'll keep you deep inside</br>
    You're always in my heart</br>
    A new life to start</br>
    I may be leaving but you're always in my heart



- lyric: >
    I'm falling into memories of you and things we used to do</br>
    Follow me there</br>
    A beautiful somewhere</br>
    A place that I can share with you



- lyric: I only need one more day; Just one more chance to say; I wish that I had gone up with you too

- lyric: You are my only, my only one

- lyric: The only love I ever knew, I threw it all away
