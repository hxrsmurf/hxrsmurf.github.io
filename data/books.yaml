- quote: I have another chance, and I will not waste it on greed. We are a family now. A proper one. From now on the Fowl name will be associated with honour and honesty.
  person: Artemis Fowl Sr.
- quote: While I was a prisoner, I thought about my life, how I had wasted it gathering riches whatever the cost to my family and others around me. In a man's life, he gets a few chances to make a difference. To do the right thing. To be a hero, if you will. I intend to become involved in that struggle. I never got involved before. I always thought the world could not be changed. But things are different now. My priorities are different. I intend to seize the day. Be the hero that every father should be. And what about you, Arty? Will you make the journey with me? When the moment comes, will you take your chance to be a hero? (Eternity Code, P.156)
  person: Artemis Fowl Sr.

- quote: ."I can't be sure," the centaur replied. "But I'm guessing that Holly's magic wasn't enough. Some of Butler's own life force was needed for the healing. About fifteen years' worth by the looks of it."
  person: Foaly
- quote: Koboi? Koboi? Those wings of hers are ridiculous. If you ask me, we're using far too much Koboi technology these days. It's not good to let one company have all LEP's business.

  person: Foaly
- quote: For a job like this, we need our very best. And that's me. I'm reactivating myself.
  person: Commander Root
- quote: That would spell the end of everything, unless the Mud People had learned to coexist with other species. And if history had taught any lessons it was that humans couldn't get along with anyone, even themselves.
  person: Commander Root
- quote: Well, there's a big difference between stunning a cardboard cutout and a real person.
  person: Commander Root
- quote: How far was he prepared to go for this gold? He didn't know, and wouldn't until the time came.
  person: Artemis
- quote: Ah yes, the trusty time paradox. If I go back in time and kill my grandfather, then shall I cease to exist? I believe, as Gorben and Berndt did, that any repercussions are already being felt. We can only change the future, not the past or present. If I go back, then I have already been back.

  person: Holly

  person: Holly (Eternity Code, P.302)
- quote: Friendship is not a science, Mud Boy. Forget about your massive brain for one minute. Just do what you feel is right.
  person: Holly (Opal Deception, P.227)
- quote: I know, big man. That's why I do it. Think if me as on-the-job training."
  person: Holly (The Lost Colony, P. 131)

  person: Dr. Po
- quote: Two hundred goblins versus our virtually unarmed three heroes. It was going to be close.
  person: Narrator
- quote: But Mulch quickly discovered that Mud People could find a reason to distrust almost anyone. Height, weight, skin colour, religion. It was almost safer to be different in some way
  person: Narrator
- quote: It was an electric moment. Not only because Pex had actually had an idea, but because it was actually a good one.
  person: Narrator (Eternity Code, P.255)
- quote: Ambition had a price, and that price was friendship.
  person:  Narrator Cudgeon 
- quote: I'm worried about you, Arty. Someone your age shouldn't be quite so...responsible. Don't worry about us; worry about school and friends. Think about what you really want to do. Use that big brain of yours to make yourself and other people happy. Forget the family business. Living is the family business now.
  person: Angeline Fowl (Opal Deception, P.95)
- quote: ."No, you don't," he grunted, tightening his inhidden grip. "I've put up with too much hardship over the years for you to disappear on me now." And so Butler reached down through the decades and yanked his young charge back from the past.

- person: Hermes
  quote: Young people don't always do what they're told, but if they can pull it off and do something wonderful, sometimes they escape punishment.

- person: Hermes
  quote: If there's one thing I've learned over the eons, it's that you can't give up on your family, no matter how tempting they make it. It doesn't matter if they hate you, or embarrass you, or simply don't appreciate your genius for inventing the Internet.

- person: Mr. Dionysus
  quote: My point is you heroes never change. You accuse us gods of being vain. You should look at yourselves. You take what you want, use whoever you have to, and then you betray everyone around you. So you'll excuse me if I have no love for heroes. They are a selfish, ungrateful lot. Ask Ariadne. Or Medea. For that matter, ask ZoÃ« Nightshade.

- person: Dionysus
  quote: But, remember, boy, that a kind act can sometimes be as powerful as an award.

- person: Athena
  quote: Do not judge me too harshly, half blood. Wise counsel is not always popular, but inspire the truth. You are dangerous.

- person: Hera
  quote: Getting something and having the wits to use it...those are two different things. I'm sure your mother Athena would agree.

- person: Hephaestus
  quote: Be careful of love. It'll twist your brain around and leave you thinking up is down and right is wrong.

- person: Achilles
  quote: Let the gods witness I tried. Hero, if you must do this, concentrate on your mortal point. Imagine one spot of your body that will remain vulnerable. This is the point where your soul will anchor your body to the world. It will be your greatest weakness, but also your only hope. No man may be completely invulnerable. Lose sight of what keeps you mortal, and the River Styx will burn you to ashes. You will cease to exist.

- person: Sadie
  quote: Why did adults have to be so thick? They always say "tell the truth," and when you do, they don't believe you. What's the point?

  quote: You're beginning to understand. Words are the source of all power. And names are now than just a collection of letters.
  
- quote: Usually people stress situational factors to explain their own failures and dispositional factors to explain their own successes (for example, "I failed he exam because the teacher can't explain the subject" versus "I passed the exam because I studied hard"). With regard to other people's failures or shortcomings, people tend to stress dispositional factors ("She doesn't car about school"; "He didn't try"). With regard to others' successes, people tend to emphasize situational factors ("She passed the test because it was easy").

- quote: The idea that "no two languages are ever sufficiently similar to be considered as representing the same social reality. The worlds in which different societies live are distinct worlds, not merely the same world with different labels attached."

- quote: The barrier between Mexico and the United States serves "as a potent political symbol used to convey the illusion that [the] United States is in control of its borders during a time of almost intolerable economic uncertainty."

- quote: (p. 216) When we reify categories, we act as if people are those categories. When people do things or appear in ways that don't fit their assigned racial category, we act as if something is wrong with them or that they are the exceptions to the rule rather than questioning the category scheme...

- quote:  (p. 217) As for those of Arab ancestry, the U.S. government labels them white

  person: George W. Bush upon launching attack on Afghanistan, 2001
- quote: Those we lost were last seen on duty. Their final act on this Earth was to fight a great evil and bring liberty to others. All of you - all in this generation of our military - have taken up the highest calling of history. You're defending your country, and protecting the innocent from harm. And wherever you go, you carry a message of hope - a message that is ancient and ever new. In the words of the prophet Isaiah, "To the captives, 'come out,' - and to those in darkness, 'be free.'
  person: George W. Bush upon sending troops to Iraq in 2003
- quote: "The cause of securing our country is not complete. But tonight, we are once again reminded that America can do whatever we set our mind to. That is the story of our history, whether it's the pursuit of prosperity for our people, or the struggle for equality for all our citizens; our commitment to stand up for our values abroad, and our sacrifices to make the world a safer place. Let us remember that we can do these things not just because of wealth or power, but because of who we are: one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all."
  person: Barack Obama on the death of Osama Bin Laden
- person: Narrator (P. 34, The Bad Beginning)
  quote: ...but it is a sad truth in life that when someone has lost a love one, friends sometimes avoid the person, just when the presence of friends is most needed.

- person: Narrator
  quote: Unless you have been very, very lucky, you have undoubtedly experienced events in your life that have made you cry. So unless you have been very, very lucky, you know that a good, long session of weeping can often make you feel better, even if your circumstances have not changed one bit.

- person: Narrator
  quote: It is very useful, when one is young, to learn the difference between "literally" and "figuratively." If something happens literally, it actually happens; if something happens figuratively, it feels like it is happening. If you are literally jumping for joy, for instance, it means you are leaping in the air because you are very happy. If you are figuratively jumping for joy, it means you are so happy that you could jump for joy, but are saving your energy for other matters.
  
- person: Narrator
  quote: There is nothing like looking, if you want to find something. You certainly usually find something, if you look, but it is not always quite the something you were after.

  quote: >
    What you saw belongs to you. A story doesn't live until it is imagined in someone's mind. </br>
    What does the story mean, then?</br>
    It means what you want it to mean, the purpose of a storyteller is not to tell you how to think, but to give you questions to think upon. Too often, we forget that.- person: Meg Finn (p.15)
  quote: This wasn't real. It couldn't be happening to her. Fourteen-year-olds didn't die; they went through a troublesome phase and grew out of it. 

- person: Lowrie (p. 58)
  quote: Regret is a powerful incentive.

- person: Lowrie (p. 91)
  quote: We all think we're going to live forever. Then bang! Our time is up and we haven't done any of the things we thought we'd do. Well, not me. I've got a chance to redeem myself. And a partner to help me do it.

- person: Narrator (p. 127)
  quote: From above, Lowrie looked even more pathetic. Even a new suit couldn't disguise the droop in his shoulders or the shake in his hand. It was obvious, even to a teenager, that he couldn't go on like this. His six months could become weeks, even days, if he kept going at this rate.
